The Document Object

The document object represents the content of the web page loaded in the browser. It is the root node of the HTML document and provides a gateway to manipulate the structure and style of the page. Through the document object, developers can access and modify elements, set or get attributes, and react to or trigger events.
 
The Window Object

The window object, on the other hand, represents the browser window or frame that displays the document's content. It is the top-level object in the browser's scripting environment and holds global variables, functions, and the document object itself.
